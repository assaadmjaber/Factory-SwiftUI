The purpose of this project is to demo commonly used user interface components in SwiftUI by creating examples of these components in action, outlining component utility per documentation found in Apple's online SwiftUI API reference and online videos about SwiftUI from WWDC. 

1. Vertical Scroll View - demoing a scroll view using ScrollView and SwiftUI's ForEach constructor and combining it with @State property 'single source of truth' which animates a symbol effect in SymbolEffectView.
